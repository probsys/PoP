#### Abstract

There are multiple approaches to deal with computations that have to run on
massive data sets, e.g., randomised algorithms or machine learning. There
is also a  third approach: make the classic deterministic algorithms able
to consume an input and/or produce an output that vastly exceeds the
machine's internal memory. To do so, one needs to optimise the algorithm's
access to data. That is, it needs to be I/O-efficient.

This talk is a short guided tour of the prior 36 years of research into
I/O-efficient computation, starting with the I/O-model by Aggarwal and
Vitter, then looking at the foundational I/O-efficient data structures, to
then finally combining these data structures into algorithms that can
handle petabytes of data without breaking a sweat.

#### Bio

Steffan Sølvsten is a PhD student at Aarhus University, Denmark, where he
attempts to bridge the gap between algorithms and formal methods. Aarhus
University is world renowned for its contributions to designing
I/O-efficient algorithms; Steffan's research applies these techniques to
Decision Diagrams - both in theory and in practice.
