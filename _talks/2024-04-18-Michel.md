#### Abstract

Computations in physical simulation, computer graphics, and probabilistic
inference often require the differentiation of discontinuous processes due
to contact, occlusion, and changes at a point in time. Popular
differentiable programming languages, such as PyTorch and JAX, ignore
discontinuities during differentiation. This is incorrect for
\textit{parametric discontinuities}---conditionals containing at least one
real-valued parameter and at least one variable of integration. We
introduce Potto, the first differentiable first-order programming language
to soundly differentiate parametric discontinuities. We present a
denotational semantics for programs and program derivatives and show the
two accord. We describe the implementation of Potto, which enables separate
compilation of programs. Our prototype implementation overcomes previous
compile-time bottlenecks achieving an 88.1x and 441.2x speed up in compile
time and a 2.5x and 7.9x speed up in runtime, respectively, on two
increasingly large image stylization benchmarks. We showcase Potto by
implementing a prototype differentiable renderer with separately compiled
shaders.


#### Bio

Jesse Michel is a fourth year PhD student in the Programming Systems Group
at MIT advised by Michael Carbin. He is visiting CMU this semester to work
with Feras Saad on automatic differentiation of probabilistic programs. He
completed his undergraduate in pure math and computer science at MIT and
his Master's in Engineering at MIT on speeding up arbitrary-precision
arithmetic using automatic differentiation. He is the recipient of the
Ashar Aziz Presidential Fellowship.
