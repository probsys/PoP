#### Abstract
Many algorithms for analyzing parallel programs, for example to detect
deadlocks or data races or to calculate the execution cost, are based on
a model variously known as a cost graph, computation graph, or
dependency graph, which captures the parallel structure of threads in a
program. In modern parallel programs, computation graphs are highly
dynamic and depend greatly on the program inputs and execution details.
As such, most analyses that use these graphs are either dynamic analyses
or are specialized static analyses that gather a subset of dependency
information for a specific purpose.

In this talk, I'll briefly discuss my work on graph types, which
compactly represent all of the graphs that could arise from program
execution and can be inferred from a parallel program using a graph type
system. The graph type system introduces unique names for vertices in
the graph; uniqueness is ensured using an affine type system. I will
also discuss recent work on extending the graph type system to handle
data structures containing, or built using, futures, which requires
indexing types in the graph type system with corecursive structures of
vertex names

#### Bio
Stefan Muller is an Assistant Professor at the Illinois Institute
of Technology working on the design of type systems and static analysis
for safe and efficient parallel programming. Before joining Illinois
Tech in 2020, he completed a PhD and postdoc at Carnegie Mellon
University, working under Umut Acar and Jan Hoffmann.
