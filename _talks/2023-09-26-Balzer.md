#### Abstract

Today's application landscape is typically concurrent, making concurrent programming a necessity.  Writing correct concurrent code is --- as we all know --- notoriously difficult.  My research is concerned with the development of rigorous reasoning techniques, such as type systems, proof methods, and verification logics, to enable the construction of provably correct and safe concurrent software.

In this talk, I focus on my work on developing type systems for concurrent programming based on linear logic.  I first introduce a type system for message-passing concurrency where types prescribe communication protocols and type checking ensures that well-typed programs adhere to these protocols [1-3].  The resulting type system is implemented as an EDSL in Rust [4-5], taking advantage of Rust' ownership type system.  Then I introduce a Rust-like type system for shared memory concurrency with higher-order locks [1], allowing locks to be passed as values and stored in other locks.  Type-checking ensures that well-typed programs are free of memory leaks and deadlocks.  These correctness guarantees have been verified in the Coq proof assistant [6-8].  I conclude my talk with an overview of ongoing work and future research directions.
