#### Abstract

Amazon Web Services (AWS) is the worldâ€™s most comprehensive
and broadly adopted cloud platform, offering over 200 fully featured
services from data centers globally. This talk will give an overview of
work at Amazon that uses automated reasoning to deliver provable
guarantees for these products, and how we can scale formal verification
to keep up with the rapidly growing number of features.
