#### Abstract

The promise of quantum computing has tantalized researchers for decades,
and recent breakthroughs in physical implementations have brought this
technology closer to reality. However, the quantum computing landscape
remains highly dynamic: competing physical substrates, fault tolerance
schemes, and architectures continue to emerge with no clear frontrunner.
This diversity creates a significant bottleneck in the compilation pipeline
â€“ developing and maintaining separate compilers for each new device or
experimental setup is both time-consuming and error-prone.

In this talk, I will present an alternative approach: automatically
synthesizing device-specific quantum circuit compilers. This
synthesis-based methodology enables rapid iteration while maintaining
correctness guarantees. I will focus on the optimizer component, which
reduces circuit size to minimize quantum computation errors. I will
demonstrate how automatically synthesized optimizers can achieve superior
performance compared to sophisticated hand-crafted alternatives.

This talk is based on joint work with Amanda Xu, Abtin Molavi, and Swamit
Tannu.
